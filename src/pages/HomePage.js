  <p>Love is awful! It’s awful. It’s painful. It’s frightening, it makes you doubt
  yourself, judge yourself, distance yourself from other people in your life. Makes you 
  selfish. Makes you creepy. It makes you obsessed with your hair. Makes you cruel. Makes 
  you say and do things you never thought you would do...</p>
